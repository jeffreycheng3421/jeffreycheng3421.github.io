Recently, I've been tinkering with a Flygon/Accelgor/Dusknoir list from the Nationals/Worlds 2014 format.

Here's the 52 card skeleton that I consider absolutely necessary:

Pokemon:
4-1-3 Flygon
2-0-2 Dusknoir
2-2 Accelgor

Trainers:
4 Skyla
4 N
2 Colress
4 Tropical Beach
4 Ultra Ball
4 Rare Candy
4 Float Stone
3 Level Ball
1 Max Potion
1 Startling Megaphone
1 Sacred Ash
1 Dowsing Machine

Energy:
4 DCE

I've elected to do +1 Flygon, +1 Dusclops, +1 Shelmet, +1 Mewtwo EX, +1 Colress, +1 Professor Juniper, +1 Max Potion, +1 Startling Megaphone to round out my 60.

Notes: 
It's possible that Professor Juniper is strictly worse than Colress. I haven't decided yet.
Super Rod vs. Sacred Ash is debatable.
I consider Dowsing Machine to be strictly better than Computer Search.
