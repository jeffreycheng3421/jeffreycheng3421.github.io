Recently, I've been tinkering with a Flygon/Accelgor/Dusknoir list from the Nationals/Worlds 2014 format.

Here's the 52 card skeleton that I consider absolutely necessary:

Pokemon:<br>
4-1-3 Flygon<br>
2-0-2 Dusknoir<br>
2-2 Accelgor<br>

Trainers:<br>
4 Skyla<br>
4 N<br>
2 Colress<br>
4 Tropical Beach<br>
4 Ultra Ball<br>
4 Rare Candy<br>
4 Float Stone<br>
3 Level Ball<br>
1 Max Potion<br>
1 Startling Megaphone<br>
1 Sacred Ash<br>
1 Dowsing Machine<br>

Energy:<br>
4 DCE<br>

I've elected to do +1 Flygon, +1 Dusclops, +1 Shelmet, +1 Mewtwo EX, +1 Colress, +1 Professor Juniper, +1 Max Potion, +1 Startling Megaphone to round out my 60.

Notes: 
It's possible that Professor Juniper is strictly worse than Colress. I haven't decided yet.
Super Rod vs. Sacred Ash is debatable.
I consider Dowsing Machine to be strictly better than Computer Search.
