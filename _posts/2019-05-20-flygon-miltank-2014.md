title: Flygon-Miltank 2014
tags: [Pokemon]

Flygon-Miltank was a deck that saw no recognition and no accomplishment (outside of a top 8 finish in the Senior Division of Worlds 2014 by Ishaan Jagiasi). My experimentation with Flygon-Accelgor, one of my favorite decks of the year, led me to consider this deck for the first time in years. 

Here's my list:

Pokemon:
3-0-3 Flygon
3-1-3 Dusknoir
4 Miltank
1 Druddigon

Trainers:
4 Skyla
4 N
3 Professor Juniper
1 Colress
1 Lysandre
3 Tropical Beach
4 Ultra Ball
4 Rare Candy
3 Float Stone
2 Level Ball
1 Max Potion
2 Startling Megaphone
1 Silver Bangle
1 Muscle Band
1 Escape Rope
1 Dowsing Machine

Energy:
2 Fairy
4 DCE


Notes: 
I spent a long time playing with -1 Level Ball +1 Vibrava. I think 1 Level Ball is completely fine but I currently have nothing better to replace the Vibrava with.
This deck plays Druddigon over Mewtwo because the VirGen matchup is already extremely strong, which is not the case for Flygon-Accelgor.
I probably wouldn't play this for a tournament over Flygon-Accelgor. It has a stronger VirGen matchup in exchange for weaker matchups against all other big basic decks (Yveltal-Garb in particular). 
Fairy energy is played for the purpose of giving free retreat with Fairy Garden found in some Aromatisse decks. Ishaan's list played fighting energy, which is also only useful in fringe scenarios.
