Virizion/Genesect (VirGen) won Worlds in the masters division in 2014. I think it's extremely vanilla and loses most matchups against evolution decks. I consider myself bad at big basic matchups and mirrors in general (I am probably pretty bad at the VirGen vs. Yveltal/Garb matchup, which is why I never played Virgen in this format). However, I think it does in general have strong matchups against most Yveltal/dark decks in general. 

Here's my list:

Pokemon:<br>
4 Virizion EX <br>
4 Genesect EX <br>
1 Jirachi EX <br>
1 Mr. Mime <br>

Trainers:<br>
4 Skyla <br>
4 N <br>
4 Professor Juniper <br>
2 Shadow Triad<br>
1 Colress<br>
3 Tropical Beach<br>
4 Ultra Ball<br>
3 Muscle Band<br>
3 Energy Switch<br>
2 Enhanced Hammer<br>
2 Tool Scrapper<br>
2 Skyarrow Bridge<br>
1 Escape Rope<br>
1 Super Rod<br>
1 Professor's Letter<br>
1 Town Map<br>
1 Colress Machine<br>
1 G Booster<br>

Energy: <br>
4 Plasma<br>
9 Grass<br>


Notes: 
My list is just the list that won Worlds 2014 -1 Skyarrow Bridge +1 Escape Rope. I'm keeping this here for reference purposes, but did not play it in any tournaments and probably would not if I were to play any tournaments of the format in the future.
