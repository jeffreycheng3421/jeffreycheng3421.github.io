Project linked [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jeffreycheng3421/jeffreycheng3421.github.io/blob/master/rpdfs/Final_Project_Complete.pdf).

This was done as my final project for MATH2820L at Vanderbilt University, Spring 2019.

UPDATE(06/11/19): I typeset the project in LaTeX for practice and greater legibility. LaTeX writeup linked [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jeffreycheng3421/jeffreycheng3421.github.io/blob/master/rpdfs/Racial%20Differentials%20Project.pdf).
