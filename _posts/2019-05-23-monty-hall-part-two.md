title: Monty Hall: Revisisted

My discussion on the Monty Hall problem led me to want to create a Monte Carlo Simulation of the problem, so I did. The actual "simulation" for the case where the switch is not made is unnecessarily rigorous: the whole process of choosing a door to be offered to the player is irrelevant if the player is not going to switch anyway. I did so because I merely had to adapt my code from the scenario where the switch is made to create the scenario where the switch is not made.
Monte Carlo Simulation linked [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jeffreycheng3421/jeffreycheng3421.github.io/blob/master/rpdfs/Monty_Hall_Monte_Carlo_Simulation.pdf).
