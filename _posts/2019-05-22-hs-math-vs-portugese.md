title: Math vs. Portugese Scores in High School Students
---
Project linked [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jeffreycheng3421/jeffreycheng3421.github.io/blob/master/rpdfs/Intelligence.pdf).

My hypothesis for why low math splitters (people with low math scores and good Portugese scores) exist is due to the difference in the amount of time spent studying for each subject respectively (whether explicitly or implicitly). The next step in this study would be to look at a population of adults who are removed from both Portugese and mathematics respectively (i.e. have both spent little-no time with both subjects) to see whether differences exist in scores in this population.
