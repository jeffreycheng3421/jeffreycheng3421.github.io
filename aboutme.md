title: About me
---
My name is Jeffrey. I'm currently a 2nd year student at Vanderbilt University studying mathematics. I'm interested in statistics, probability, and data analysis projects in R. On the side, I play the Pokemon Trading Card Game (used to play more competitively, as of recent I am a more casual player) and teach martial arts.
