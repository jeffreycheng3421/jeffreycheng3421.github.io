I'm currently a senior at [Vanderbilt University](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/) studying mathematics with plans to do graduate study in the future. I'm interested in differential geometry/topology and combinatorial group theory. I also have a budding side interest in science news reporting. My hobbies include playing the Pokemon Trading Card Game (used to play more competitively, as of recent I am a more casual player), martial arts and piano.
