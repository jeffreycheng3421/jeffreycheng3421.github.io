title: About me
---
I'm currently a 2nd year student at Vanderbilt University studying mathematics. I'm interested in statistics, probability—specifically combinatorics—, and algebraic structures. My hobbies include playing the Pokemon Trading Card Game (used to play more competitively, as of recent I am a more casual player), martial arts, piano, and conducting various data analyses projects in R.
