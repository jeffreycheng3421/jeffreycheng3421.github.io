I'm currently a 2nd year student at [Vanderbilt University](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/) studying mathematics. I'm interested in statistics and probability (specifically combinatorics, Monte Carlo simulations, MLE's, & moment-generated point estimators) and algebraic structures. My hobbies include playing the Pokemon Trading Card Game (used to play more competitively, as of recent I am a more casual player), martial arts, piano, and conducting various data analyses projects in R.
